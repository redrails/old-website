<h3>What are Bitcoins?</h3>
<hr>
<h4><a id="Wikipedias_definition_16"></a>Wikipedia’s definition:</h4>
<p>Bitcoin is an open source peer-to-peer electronic money and payment network introduced in 2009 by pseudonymous developer “Satoshi Nakamoto”. Bitcoin has been called a cryptocurrency because it uses cryptography to secure transactions. Digitally signed payment messages are broadcast to and verified by a decentralized network. Specialized computers use a proof-of-work system to prevent double-spending, a problem for digital currencies. The operators of these computers, known as “miners”, are rewarded with transaction fees and newly minted Bitcoins.</p>
<h4><a id="My_definition_19"></a>My definition:</h4>
<p>Bitcoin is an online virtual crypto-currency which allows instant payments over the internet to anywhere in the world. Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer technology where there is no controlling authority. It is purely functional by users, which makes it very fascinating. Bitcoin software was originally developed by Satoshi Nakamoto and was made open source.</p>
<h3><a id="Who_uses_Bitcoins_22"></a>Who uses Bitcoins</h3>
<hr>
<p>Bitcoins are an online currency, which means that you do not physically contain them. So narrowing down the question to, “Who, on the internet uses Bitcoins”. Well, many many people use it and most of you may have heard of Silk Road, an illegal drugs market hosted on the TOR network. Silk Road’s items were all priced in Bitcoins, so a buyer can simply trade drugs for Bitcoins which made the buyer secure as he/she did not need to make any bank/PayPal transfers thus not revealing any information. There are many other marketplaces that make use of the Bitcoin currency such as: Betcas, BitRoad, HomeAway and also general users that want to sell items for Bitcoins instead of <em>real-life</em> money.</p>
<h5><a id="How_Bitcoins_Work_27"></a>How Bitcoins Work</h5>
<hr>
<p>Note: If you’re not into the technical stuff then skip this section.</p>
<p>As we discussed, Bitcoin is an online crypto-currency which basically means that it is a virtual currency that uses cryptography for security in exchange. The cryptographic properties of crypto-currencies make them very anonymous and there is no central authority for distribution or control. The anonymous nature of crypto-currency transactions makes them well-suited for a host of nefarious activities such as money laundering and tax evasion.</p>
<p>Let’s have a look at a real-life example on how Bitcoins may be used and how they work:</p>
<p>So let’s assume we have two people that want to make a transaction, let’s call them Toby and John.</p>
<p><img src="http://puu.sh/5wMi2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Now let’s assume that John has sold Toby something, it can be anything and Toby and John have both agreed to trade in Bitcoins. So Toby and John both have a Bitcoin client Software (we’ll talk about this later on). These clients will provide both parties; Toby and John to conduct a transaction. So Toby acquired John’s <em>public-key</em> to send the Bitcoins to. (Note: When you send Bitcoins, you are virtually sending a ciphered value of something, so Bitcoins are virtually just a bunch of numbers/letters/symbols which are deciphered by a client of the party [john] to use.)</p>
<p><img src="http://puu.sh/5wMTp.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Toby now uses John’s public-key, commonly referred to as an address, which Toby combines with the amount of Bitcoins to transfer, and Toby then uses his private-key to sign the transaction. Toby now sends the transaction over to John, at this time the whole network can see the transaction but as it is signed by Toby’s <em>private-key</em> it is impossible for anyone other than John to decrypt the value. The transaction is recorded in a blockchain which holds all a record of all transactions done over the Bitcoin network.</p>

<h5><a id="How_to_use_Bitcoins_51"></a>How to use Bitcoins</h5>
<hr>
<p>In this section I will explain how you, yourself can use Bitcoins and what required tools there are.Step one is simple, you need to find a Bitcoin client which is basically a wallet that stored your Bitcoins and gives you a public/private key as we saw in Toby/John’s transaction example. It is VERY important that you NEVER share your private key with anyone, hence private. You may share your public key anywhere for people to send you Bitcoins. There are many Bitcoin wallets that you can use, some online and some that run on your PC/phone. I recommend using MultiBit as it runs on all deskop operating systems, if you want to use Bitcoin on your Android smartphone or tablet you can use an application called Bitcoin wallet.
After you have installed a wallet you can share your wallet address (public key) to anyone, you can tweet it, put it on Reddit and give it to anyone that wishes to make a transaction with you.
After you’re all set up, that is it. You’re ready to start making some Bitcoins.</p>
<h3><a id="How_to_obtain_Bitcoins_58"></a>How to obtain Bitcoins</h3>
<hr>
<p>This is the most important element of Bitcoins, it is how Bitcoins exist.</p>
<p>There are many ways to make Bitcoins I will explain these methods in little details and you can research them further on the internet.</p>
<p>The simplest way to obtain Bitcoins is by trading goods/services for the Bitcoin currency. Instead of selling your cellphone or laptop for US dollars on ebay you can sell these items for Bitcoins on marketplaces that allow the currency. This is probably the easiest way to earn will work out very effective as the exchange rates of Bitcoin fluctuate every minute.</p>
<p>Mining Bitcoins (technical stuff)</p>
<p>This is where all the confusion is and this is one of the biggest aspects of obtaining Bitcoins.</p>
<p>The actual mining of Bitcoins is by a purely mathematical process. A useful analogy is with the search for prime numbers: it used to be fairly easy to find the small ones (Eratothenes in Ancient Greece produced the first algorithm for finding them). But as they were found it got harder to find the larger ones. Nowadays researchers use advanced high-performance computers to find them and their achievements are noted by the mathematical community (for example, the University of Tennessee maintains a list of the highest 5000). For Bitcoins the search is not actually for prime numbers but to find a sequence of data (called a ‘block’) that produces a particular pattern when the Bitcoin ‘hash’ algorithm is applied to the data. When a match occurs the miner obtains a bounty of Bitcoins (and also a fee if that block was used to certify a transaction). The size of the bounty reduces as Bitcoins around the world are mined. As it stands, mining solo is very nearly deprecated. The process of finding blocks is now so popular and the difficulty of finding a block so high that it could take over three years to generate any coins. While you could simply set a machine aside and have it run the algorithms endlessly, the energy cost and equipment deprecation will eventually cost more than the actual Bitcoins are worth, so is it really worth it to get into this business?</p>
<p>Let’s see how Bitcoins are mined:</p>
<ol>
<li>You install a wallet, as we discussed in the previous part</li>
<li>Join a pool. A pool is a group of people called miners who, like you are also trying to obtain Bitcoins. You join a group and work as a team to find these Bitcoins, which are then distributed along the pool.  The most popular is Slush’s Pool found here. You can also try guilds like BTC Guild as well as a number of other options. Each of the pools is characterized mostly by the fees they charge per block – 2% for Slush’s pool, for example – and the number of users. Pools with fewer users could also have a slower discovery time but pools with many users usually result in smaller payments. After you have joined a pool you’re ready to get started.</li>
<li>Get a Miner – There are a lot of mining options for all types of platforms. Miners use spare GPU cycles to power the mining operation, much like services like SETI@Home uses spare cycles for finding intelligent life. Miners, on the other hand, use these cycles to help handle peer-to-peer processes associated with bitcoins. Thus by doing “work” you are maintaining the network as well. If you’re using Windows, I recommend using GUI Miner it is very simple and straightforward.</li>
<li>Stay dedicated – The process of finding Bitcoins is very time-consuming and there is only a probability that you’ll even get any Bitcoins, so don’t be too disappointed if you do not see results in days or weeks. The simple rule in the BTC world is, as more Bitcoins are found it is made harder and harder for more to be found.</li>
</ol>
<h3><a id="Mathematics_80"></a>Mathematics</h3>
<hr>
<p>What is a cryptographic hash function?</p>
<p>Cryptography itself is a way of encrypting messages into ciphertext which hides the message into code that only a desired party can decrypt. It is used for privacy against intruders and to protect information. A hash function however is a function where you feed a message into a mathematically created system which applies many computational methods to a message that it is fed and outputs a digest. Unlike encryption, hash functions CANNOT be deciphered using a password or key. They are irreversible however the NSA has claimed collision vulnerabilities on many hash functions. There are many hash functions used everywhere such as: MD5, SHA1, SHA256, RIPEMD, WHIRLPOOL etc. A very interesting properly of a hash function is that you can feed a string of any character size into it but the output will ALWAYS be one size. Whether it is 1 character of plaintext, or your 5000 word school essay.</p>
<p>So let’s sum of some properties of hash functions:
Computationally efficient (hash functions should be generated in very small time. Should not take long at all.)
A fixed digest output (as we said the digest should only be one size)
Collision Resistance (the output of two given arbitrary messages should never be the same in any case.)
Hide information about the input (a pattern in the input e.g. is the input even numbers or odd numbers? Is the input in uppercase letters or lowercase letters? Etc)
Look random (there should not give any patters of the input at all)
Digital Signatures:</p>
<p>Like hand signatures, digital signatures are used for verification or legitimacy or even proof of party. They are used to digitally sign protocols or documents for proof of identity.</p>
<p>Let’s look at an example again, involving Toby and John. Let’s assume that Toby wants to digitally sign a document. In the process Toby is first going to generate two keys known as signing key also known as a private key and a verification key also known as a public key.</p>
<p><img src="http://puu.sh/5wQCx.png" alt=""></p>
<p>These keys are mathematically produced and it should be hard or impossible for a person to solve a signing key using a verification key. Let’s assume that Toby wants to sign the message, we’ll denote this as M. So to digitally sign it, M will go through a process of mathematical functions along with Toby’s signing key and we will get an output of ciphered information known as the signature denoted as SM.</p>
<p><img src="http://puu.sh/5wQX7.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Only the person who possesses the signing key is able to create the output SM, no one will be able to create something similar mathematically speaking.</p>
<p>Now we move on to the verification process:</p>
<p>So Toby has digitally signed the message and sent the SM + Toby’s verification key + the Message itself to John. So to verify the message John uses these components to verify the signature:</p>
<p><img src="http://puu.sh/5wRmR.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The Bitcoin system uses the similar process of using pubic-keys or wallet addresses and we substitute the M – message for the Bitcoins. So we digitally sign Bitcoins and send them to the party (john) who then uses the public key to verify and obtain the Bitcoins.</p>
<h3><a id="Economics_114"></a>Economics</h3>
<hr>
<p>As Bitcoin is a currency there is obviously the question of money supply and how the Bitcoin currency systems works, exchange rates, demand and how they are floated around.</p>
<p>Although it may seem unreal, Bitcoins are generated out of thin air, meaning that they are mined from nothing. Using mathematical values we create currency and the highest amount of Bitcoins that can exist is 21,000,000 (21 million) there cannot be more than this number of Bitcoins, after this limit no more Bitcoins can be generated or accepted the supply is stopped at that point. It is estimated that by the year 2040 all Bitcoins will be generated.</p>
<p>Bitcoin works in a very weird way. When Bitcoin first started in January of 2009, the reward for a miner to use its effort of mining Bitcoins was 50BTC per miner. Bitcoin system works by decreasing reward size by a half after every 210,000 block of algorithms are generated, the 210,000 block usually takes 4 years to fill up. So in 2009 the reward was 50BTC and now, in 2013 the reward is 25BTC.</p>
<p>The demand of Bitcoin is very high as it gets harder and harder for them to be produced. As we said, the more miners there are the harder it is to globally mine BTC’s. So from here we can conclude that Bitcoins are supplied in no correlation to demand, the demand of Bitcoins simply affects the exchange rates of BTC’s for example: There are 10,000 Bitcoins in supply all over the world, this is a very small number and if we assume that it is getting harder and harder to obtain more Bitcoins we can say that instead of supply affecting the demand, the demand in contrasts affects the exchange rates, i.e. the demand is very inelastic.</p>
<h3><a id="Anonymity_124"></a>Anonymity</h3>
<hr>
<p>Anonymity is very important and just because we’re using a crypto-currency which uses public-key-cryptography, it doesn’t always verify the anonymity of transactions. The main problem is that every transaction is publicly logged. Anyone can see the flow of Bitcoins from address to address Alone, this information can’t identify anyone because the addresses are just random numbers. However, if any of the addresses in a transaction’s past or future can be tied to an actual identity, it might be possible to work from that point and guess who may own all of the other addresses. This identity information might come from network analysis, surveillance, or just Googling the address. The officially-encouraged practice of using a new address for every transaction is designed to make this attack more difficult.</p>
<p>By necessity the history of all the Bitcoins must be highly public. However, if one has Bitcoins on paid to address, one can theoretically choose the coins they spend in a way that will minimize the amount of information they leak. Choosing personally generated coins or an address that you know doesn’t reveal information would protect you. Unfortunately, the default Bitcoin client doesn’t support this currently, so you must assume that your entire balance can identify you if any of the addresses can.</p>
<p>You may consider a Bitcoin to be “less-anonymous” when an attacker could feasibly find the true identity of a very recent owner of the Bitcoin, perhaps because one of the Bitcoin addresses was posted to a website, or because he knows some identifying information through other means.</p>
<h3><a id="Conclusion_134"></a>Conclusion</h3>
<hr>
<p>Though it may seem very hard to comprehend the idea of Bitcoins and how they work, they are becoming immensely popular as more and more people are using them. They are a great way to privately conduct business but can also be negatively impacted as there is no authority or middleman in purchases. Acknowledging all factors Bitcoins are one of the most valued and expensive currency which can make you go from poor to rich in the matter of seconds as the fluctuation of exchange rates happens every second.</p>
